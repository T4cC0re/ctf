# SCP 2159-3: Fujimor

## Points 400

ShowMeCorp recently found one of itâ€™s employees, Philipe, had been kidnapped and sold on the dark web. There are not many clues, but we have a strong reason to believe that the man who sat next to him might have had his computer hacked into. We believe that this hacking organization may have used this initial access to find personal information on Philipe that would have led to his kidnapping

Using the memory dump, ascertain what the PID was of the original process that the attacker spawned into as he exploited the system?
