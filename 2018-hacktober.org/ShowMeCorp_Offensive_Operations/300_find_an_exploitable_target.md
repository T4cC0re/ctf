# Find an Exploitable Target

## Points 300

At least one machine on ShowMeCorp's internal network is exploitable. Find that machine and exploit it.

You will find a flag and the path to your next challenge.

Still can't find the flag? Are you sure you looked at everything after you exploited the box?

(There is a flag note you must retrieve)

(This target will reset every 60 minutes, at the start of the hour)
